# code_examples
This repository has been created to show some examples of my code. In particular you can find the coding for some of my analyses performed on single nuclei and single cell datasets for my Mater Thesis in "Macosko_Telley_Goetz_processing_for_theisis.R". "Seurat_to_AnnData.R" is a script to convert a Seurat object in to h5ad format for easier handling when loading it in python. "analysis_allgene_allroi_inCB.R" is a script to construct a count matrix from a image from a Image based spatial transcriptomics method after cell segmentation. "broad_data_preparation.R" is a script to extract counts and metadata of interest from a public available spatial transcriptomics dataset. "Tangram_first_attempt_old_tutorial-broad.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook to perform label transfer of cell types identifyed in single cell datasets to spatial datasets
